# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Explore insightful data analysis on two distinct datasets in this repository. Dive into the world of finance with a bank dataset and unravel trends in the fashion industry with an apparel dataset, all through Python notebooks. Gain valuable insights into these domains with our EDA notebooks.

Welcome to our comprehensive repository where we delve into two captivating datasets, each offering a unique perspective on exploratory data analysis (EDA). In the first part, 
we explore a bank dataset that investigates the response rate of individuals regarding fixed deposits. We dissect this data based on various features including marital status,
occupation, education, salary, balance, and more. Through Python notebooks, we uncover valuable insights and patterns that shed light on the factors influencing deposit decisions.
Moving on to the second part, our EDA shifts gears towards the fashion realm. We've curated an apparel dataset that aims to predict dress recommendations based on an array of attributes 
such as style, material, fabric, season, previous sales, and more. Our notebooks dive deep into the data, revealing correlations and trends that provide a deeper understanding of the fashion industry.
Join us on this data-driven journey as we unravel intriguing stories within these datasets, empowering you to harness the power of data analysis in both the financial and fashion domains.
